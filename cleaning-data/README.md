    - fixes an abnormal value for Alkaline phosphatase that I had not caught before
    - corrects some values that cannot really be identified by hand --- for example, 2.42 instead of 2.43
    - additionally, removes a value that I had mistakenly entered in my manual corrections but does not in fact exist
